**Learning outcomes**

**Skills** 
• Be able to debug programs (i.e., methodically locate and repair errors) using tools such as 
Wing IDE and techniques such as executing tracing with print statements.  
• Use Python functions and modules to apply a divide-and-conquer strategy to program 
development. 

**Knowledge** 
• Debugging: steps in the debugging process; Wing IDE debugging features (breakpoints, 
execution stepping, tracing);  the use of print statements for the tracing of control and data 
flow; the commenting out of code to assist in bug location. 
• Functions: concepts of function, parameter, and return value; form of function declaration; 
form of function calls; scope of variables; parameter passing (pass by value, pass by 
reference); modules; conditional program execution.
