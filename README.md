Welcome to the **Python-for-School** repository! This is a collection of all my Python coding assignments completed during my studies. Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific topic or concept, providing a comprehensive overview of my learning journey.
This repository serves as a centralized location for my Python assignments. It showcases my progress, problem-solving skills, and understanding of various programming concepts. It's an excellent resource for anyone learning Python or looking for examples of school-level assignments.
The repository is organized into folders based on topics covered in Python programming. Each folder includes:
- **Assignment Files**: The Python scripts (.py) for specific tasks or problems.

### Topics Included:
1. **Input, Output, Strings, and Numbers**  
   - Assignments involving basic input/output, string manipulation, and numerical operations.  
2. **Selection and Iteration**  
   - Programs focusing on decision-making (if-else) and loops (for, while).  
3. **Data Structures**  
   - Assignments using lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples.  
4. **Functions, Testing, and Debugging**  
   - Exercises to practice defining functions, writing test cases, and debugging errors.  
5. **Recursion**  
   - Recursive solutions to problems like factorial, Fibonacci, and solving puzzles.  
6. **File Input, Output, and Exceptions**  
   - Assignments involving reading/writing files and handling exceptions.  
7. **Sorting and Searching**  
   - Implementation of algorithms like bubble sort, merge sort, and binary search.  
8. **Number Systems**  
   - Programs that convert between different number systems.
