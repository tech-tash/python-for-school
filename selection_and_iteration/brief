**Learning outcomes** 
**Skills** 
• Be able to construct and reason about Python solutions to programming problems involving 
selection and/or iteration.  
Including, 
o Constructing and reasoning about compound Boolean expressions involving the use 
of python comparison operators.  
o Constructing and reasoning about data selection expressions that use of string 
slicing and casting.

**Knowledge**
• The forms of Python if, if-else and if-elif statements. 
• Python comparison operators, the Boolean operators ‘and’, ‘not’ and ‘or’, and operator 
precedence. 
• The form of the Python for loop, and the use of break and continue statements. 
• The role of the range function in for loops. 
• The distinction between definite and indefinite loop structures. 
• Forms and possible uses of string slice and casting operations.
